# How to use so far

## Run all the folders as individual projects

## Go to localhost:9003/products

### This outputs all the current products in database

## Go to localhost:9007/products

### This should give the same output as the previous request only this time we send the request through an api-gateway

### If this works that means the microservice is working correctly
